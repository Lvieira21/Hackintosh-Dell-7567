# Personal Hackintosh Documentation/Instructions for Dell Gaming 7567

## Notice
For the High Sierra (10.13) Release: This fork of [Nihhaar's repo](https://www.github.com/Nihhaar/) uses about the same config as he made (DSDT, SSDT patches and kexts), the only difference is that I managed to work out a way to make the wireless card DW1560 work.

For the Catalina (10.15) Release: Initial USB kexts and config used are from [maxis7567's repo](https://github.com/maxis7567/hackintosh_dell_7567_catalina_install_guide), [Nihhaar's](https://www.github.com/Nihhaar/) kexts and config files were fused into this build and managed to continue using DW1560 (updated kexts), lastly I set up CPUFriend to stop the CPU from running at high frequency all the time. 
### Warning: CPU Friend is configured to be used with the same CPU as mine, if you have other CPU, you NEED to configure your own SSDT for CPUFriend. [Refer to this guide](https://www.olarila.com/topic/5693-guide-ssdt-with-pikes-pm-script-and-use-with-cpufriend/)

### Notes
 - Currently using in 10.15.6 (Catalina), don't know about Big Sur;
 - No support for 4k *(I don't have a 4k variant)*;
 - HDMI doesn't work on this hack because it is connected to nvidia card and we disabled it;
 - Wi-Fi, bluetooth, handoff and airdrop working flawlessly by replacing the intel wireless card to DW1560 and installing the right kexts (which are in Post-Install Kexts folder).

### Known Bugs
 - Stock wifi doesn't work (needs to be replaced with a compatible one);
 - 2.1 audio (2.0 works) *(I recommend the use of Boom2 App for a little bit more volume)*;
 - Audio via headphones after sleep *(Still a problem)*.

### Specs
 - Intel i7-7700HQ CPU
 - Intel HD Graphics 630 / nVidia GTX 1050 Ti
 - 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 RAM
 - 15.6‚Äù 1080p IPS Display
 - 256GB SanDisk M.2 SSD (SATA)
 - 500GB SanDisk SSD Sata3


## Troubleshooting (By Nihhaar)
**1) Backlight level is not persisting across reboot**
 - Boot into macOS
 - Mount EFI folder and delete nvram.plist in the folder
 - Clear nvram variables from terminal using `sudo nvram -c`
 - Reboot into Clover
 - Open Clover UEFI Shell and type following commands:
   ```bash
   FS0: 
   cd EFI 
   dmpstore -all -s dmpvars.txt
   ```
 - Find the GUID of the `backlight-level` variable (same for all macOS nvram variables) and type the following command in the same shell:
   ```bash
   dmpstore -d -guid <GUID of macOS variables> 
   exit
   ```
 - Reboot  

**2) Sound is not working**
 - Some higher versions of AppleALC doesn't seem to work properly. So install a tested version like 1.2.8
 - Make sure Lilu is installed & AppleALC is loaded after Lilu: If you use /L/E for kexts, make sure you have LiluFriend.kext and correctly configured
 - If you have FakePCIID kexts, remove them. These patches are already included in AppleALC(atleast in 1.2.8) and are not needed
 - Make sure kexts are loading properly. Sometimes kexts fail to load due to improper permissions. Use `Scripts/fixPersmissions.sh`
 - If none of the above worked, try posting in forums like tonymacx86.com  

**3) Fonts look blurry in mojave**
 - Apple nuked subpixel antialiasing in mojave, making non-retina screens blurry
 - This effect is noticable in 1080p but doesnt affect 4k or retina displays
 - The following makes things somewhat better:
```bash
# Type these commands in terminal and re-login to see the changes

defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2
```
 - If you want to revert back to original settings:
```bash
# Type these commands in terminal and re-login to see the changes

defaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing
defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool YES
```

**4) Scrolling is choppy with third party mice**
 - Use this tool: https://mos.caldis.me/, works well
 - Scroll direction can also be set via this tool

**5) Clover USB is not booting**
 - Probably needs port limit patch in config.plist for the OS version you are using (just google it)
 - Preferably, use USB 2.0 for avoiding port limit errors
